    <p id="p1">XPayroll supports the following biometric devices (only on our paid plans) </p>
    <p id="p2"><a href="">https://camsunit.com/product/home.html</a></p>

    <p id="p3">In particular, we recommend the <a href="">F31 Facebot</a> or <a href="">RSP10i9</a>. We do not recommend the i32 Macronium, even though it's the cheapest device.</p>
    <p id="p4">In case you already have a biometric device, you can test its compatibility with our platform by following the instructions <a href="">here</a>.</p>
    <p id="p5">Once the device is received, it just needs to be givenpower and connected to the Internet through wifi/lan. All your employees, contractors and new additions will automatically get pushed to the device over the air as well. Users need to be associated with their fingerprints (or faces, depending on the device), and once this is done it will automatically push check-in/check-outs to XPayroll.</p>
    <p id="p6">An XPayroll customer can directly purchase a device from the link given above. While adding the device to the cart, please ensure that the "Biometric Integration with Razorpay Payroll System" option has been added as well. Once the device has been received, you can follow the rest of the instructions given <a href="">here</a> to integrate it with XPayroll.</p>
    <p id="p7">Also, in case you have more than 1 account of XPayroll, the same biometric device can be integrated with multiple accounts.</p><br>
