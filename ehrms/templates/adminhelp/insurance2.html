    <p id="he">The Insurance offering on HRMS is of the type where developtrees holds the master policy on your behalf.</p>
    <p id="f"> Due to the nature of this policy, we provide you with a Payment Receipt for the complete premium payment.</p> 
    <p id="s">This is generated by developtrees for facilitating the transaction with the insurer. Apart from this, we also issue a Certificate of Insurance that contains the Insurance premium and GST details.</p>
     <p id="d">These are generated at an employee level and you can use a combination of all of these for your accounting purposes.</p>
    <p id="hg">Do note that GST input credit cannot be claimed on health insurance premium payments.More information on this is here.</p><br>
