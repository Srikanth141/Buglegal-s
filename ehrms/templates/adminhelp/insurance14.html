    <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">Can I add new employees after the initial purchase of Insurance?</p>    
    <h5 id="f">Yes, you have the option to add employees in the following scenarios -</h5>
    <p id="h">1. New employees who join your organization.</p>
    <p id="p">2. New dependents who are added (this is only allowed within 30 days of marriage or childbirth).</p><br>
    <p id="g">Whenever you add a new employee on Hrms, they are added to your Insurance cover as well. The admin on Hrms from your organization needs to finalize the purchase and make the payment for these new employees.</p> 
    <p id="pu">The premiums for any new employee additions are charged on a 1-year basis and the cover is active for a period of 1 year from the date of payment. </p>
    <p id="i">Example - If the annual premium for a 35-year-old member is â‚¹2000, and you add a member 6 months later, you would pay â‚¹2000 for that member for a 1-year coverage from their date of joining.</p><br>
    <p id="j"><b>Note -</b> In case there are insurance claims made by the employee then no refunds are issued.</p><br>
