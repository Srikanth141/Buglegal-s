        <p id="g">An employee is a person with a fixed monthly salary, who will automatically be included in
        every month's Hrms.</p>
        
        <p id="s"> Hrms optimizes the salary structure to minimize tax, and automatically deducts and pays the required TDS (tax deducted at source). </p>

        <p id="g1">Provident fund, ESI, and professional tax are applicable only to employees.</p>
        <p id="h">A contractor, on the other hand, is not on the permanent rolls of the company and can bepaid in an ad-hoc manner through the one-time payment feature of Hrms.</p><br>
