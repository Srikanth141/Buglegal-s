    <p id="g">A payment from Hrms can fail for several reasons, like -</p>
    
    <p id="g1">1.Account information errors. Either the bank account number or IFSC was invalid.</p>

      <p id="g2">2.There was an issue with the sender/recipient bank.</p>
        
      <p id="g3">3.There was an issue with NPCI. </p>
    <p id="g4">In any of these cases, Hrms will detect the issue with the payment and will send an automated email to all the administrators of the organization, as well as the recipient of the payment. This email will mention the payment details, reason for payment failure, instructions on how to fix account information errors (if any), and also a link to retry the payment. If you do not see this email, please check your spam folder.</p>
    <p id="g6">Please note that a failed payment does not imply that you need to set up a new payment. The failed payment can be reattempted. To retry the failed payment, please click on the retry link included in the email. If you're an administrator, you can also find the retry link under Reports > Ledger.</p><br>
