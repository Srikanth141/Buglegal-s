    <p id="ta">TRACES</p1><br>
    <p id="tb">registration is required by HRMS to download Form 16/16A data. If your organization is currently not registered on TRACES, we can do the same for you after filing TDS returns for any quarter. Please get in touch with support if this is required.

    </p><br>
    <p id="tc">PF & ESI </p1>
    <p id="td">registrations are required if you would like HRMS to pay and file your monthly returns for either of these schemes. Unfortunately, we do not handle the initial registration of the organization under these, but we can connect you with third-party providers who can assist you in the process.</p>
    <p id="te">Once the registration is complete, will handle all the monthly payments, filings, and employee registration.</p>
    <p id="tf">Professional Tax</p1>
    <p id="tg">Professional tax can be applicable to an organization depending on the state in which it has its operations. HRMS does not handle the initial registration but will pay and file your monthly returns once that is taken care of.</p>
