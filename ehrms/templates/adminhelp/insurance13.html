    <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">What if an employee leaves the organization after Iâ€™ve purchased Insurance?</p>    
    <p id="g">When an employee leaves the organization, you get a prorated refund based on the time remaining in the 1-year policy period. Example - If the annual premium for a 30-year old member is Rs 2000, and if the employee leaves after 6 months, then you get a refund of Rs 1000.</p><br>
    <p id="f"><b>Note -</b> In case there are insurance claims made by the employee then no refunds are issued.</p><br>
