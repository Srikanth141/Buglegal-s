    <p id="g">HRMS and compliance can get troublesome at points and you rely on expertise from your CA firms and other partners to navigate the financial year.</p>
    <p id="g1">HRMS makes life simpler for everyone by bringing together all the people and the various HRMS processes under one roof. However, once you are done executing your HRMS, you still need to share data and provide a lot of the reports for audits and other statutory requirements.</p>
    <p id="g2">We welcome you to add your CA partners to the platform. Add them as a Contractor with special access like a Chartered Accountant, Report Viewer, or Administrator role.</p>
    <p id="g3">Your partners will receive a welcome email, and be able to login and access relevant sections of the platform as you choose.</p>
