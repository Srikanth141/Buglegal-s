    <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">A new employee/contractor has not received the welcome email.</p>
    <p id="d1">First, please ensure that the email address entered in Hrms for the new employee or contractor is accurate. Typos in the email are the most frequent reason for this problem.</p>
    <p id="d2">It is also possible that your email provider is blocking the emails from Hrms and marking them as spam. 
    <p id="d3">Please check your inbox and spam folders carefully for the email.The organization administrators can also re-trigger a welcome email from the employee's profile page</p>
    <p id="d4">One more option for the employee is to go to the Hrms login page, and click on the "forgot password?" link to send themselves a password reset email.</p>
    <p id="d5">If none of this works, you can write to us at Hrms@razorpay.com, and we'll share the password reset link with you directly.</p>
    <p id="d6">To do this, please ensure that you email us from the same email address that you signed up on Hrms with, or the email address which is an administrator of the organization to which the employee belongs.</p>
