            <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">I am an employee and I have received an email that HRMS has changed/removed by tax declaration why is that?</p>
            <p id="s1">Every year, HRMS validates the tax declaration of all employees. This is usually done in January.</p>
            <p id="s2"> Before the validation exercise starts, we will usually send 2-3 emails to all employees to let them know about it so that all the proofs of those declarations can be uploaded.</p>
            <p id="s3">If you have received an email from HRMS stating that your declaration has been removed or altered.</p>
            <p id="s4"> then that will be because either you have not uploaded any proofs, or the proofs were of a different amount compared to your declaration.</p>
            <p id="s5"> Do note that any such alteration will usually affect your TDS and thus your in-hand salary in future HRMS.</p>
            <p id="s6">Even after receiving this email, you can still update your tax declaration by going to the Tax Deductions page in HRMS.</p>
            <p id="s7 ">However, any update that you make now will have to be approved by your organization's HRMS administrators.</p>
            <p id="s8"> Please do not contact HRMS support for these approvals since we only validate the proofs once. </p>
