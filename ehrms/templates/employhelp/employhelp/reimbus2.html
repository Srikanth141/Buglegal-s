    <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">How do I pay Reimbursement to an Employee?</p>
    <p id="h2">After reimbursements have been approved, they can be paid out from XPayroll in two ways -</p>
    <p id="h3">1.With payroll - In this mode, XPayroll will automatically include all approved reimbursements that are pending payment whenever payroll is executed.</p>
    <p id="h4">2.Ad-hoc - In this mode, you can choose to pay approved reimbursements at any point, independent of payroll execution.</p>
    <p id="h5">To do this, go to the left navigation bar <b>Pay Employees> Reimbursements,</b> and check the<b> Pending Payments section</b>. You will be able to select which all employees you would like to pay reimbursements for and trigger the payout immediately. </p> 
    <p id="h6">To pick between these modes, please go to <b>Settings > Reimbursements Setup.</b></p><br>
