    <p id="ta">No, group insurance doesn't allow any selection.</p>
    <p id="tb">If you choose to take the ESC plan, you will have to cover spouses of all married employees and all dependent children.</p>
    <p id="tc">There is also a minimum cap on the number of parents. The total number of parents should be 1.6 times the number of employees. Example - If your organization has 10 employees and you want to cover parents then we would need a minimum of 16 parents to be covered..</p><br>
