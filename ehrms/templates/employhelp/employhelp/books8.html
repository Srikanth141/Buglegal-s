    <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">I have done the integration. When do I see the entries being made into QuickBooks?</p>
        <p id="j">You will see the accounts created and few entries created within 2 hours but we suggest you wait for 24 hours since the syncing of the past data takes up to 24 hours.
        <p id="f"> Do note that entries are made when the transaction is Successful, hence the entries for the compliance payments may take a couple of weeks to reflect since the compliance payments are made at a monthly cadence.</p>
