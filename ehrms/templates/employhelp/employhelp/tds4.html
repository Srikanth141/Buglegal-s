    <p id="ta">While XPayroll verifies all IT declarations in January, some organizations might prefer to do this later. We do not recommend this, since a change (usually a reduction) in an employee's declaration leads to an increase in their TDS, and we would ideally like to spread this over a few months of payroll.. </p><br>
    
    <p id="tb">If you do want to request a delay in your verifications, please follow these steps -.</p><br>

    <p id="tc">1.Go to Settings > Tax Deductions Setup, and disable XPayroll verification of tax deductions. This will ensure that we exclude you from the regular cycle of verifications.<br>

        2.When you're ready for verifications, switch this option back on and write an email to support. Please note that we will do this on a "best efforts basis" and we do not guarantee it.</p><br>
