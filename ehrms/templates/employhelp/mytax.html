        <p1>How can I reduce my tax?<p1>
        <p>There are three primary ways in which employees can reduce their tax liability -</p>
        <p>1. If you pay rent, please ensure that Hrms knows that by putting in the required<br>
            information in the tax deduction page. If your rent exceeds Rs. 8,333 per month, then you<br>
            also need to provide your landlord's name, address and PAN number.</p>
        <p>2. You can make investments, several of which give you tax benefits. For more <br>
            information, please click here. If you plan to make some investments in this financial year,<br>
             but haven't yet, you can still put in an amount under the correct section so you start<br>
            receiving the tax benefits immediately. However, if you do this then you must ensure that<br>
            said investments are made before the end of the financial year, or you will get a tax notice<br>
            from the government.</p>
        <p>3. If you have taken a home loan and are paying interest on it, you can get additional tax<br>
             benefits for it. For more information, please click<a href="/Employ_home">here</a></p>
        <p>Please remember to update all this information in your<a href="/tax_slip/">tax deductions</a></p>
