        <p id="e">Developtrees takes the confidentiality of your data extremely seriously, and has adopted several measures to ensure its safety -</p>
        
        <p id="e1">1. We are SOC2 and PCI certified. That means that external auditors have looked at our data practices, and have given their stamp of approval.</p>
        <p id="e2">2. We have an in-house security team that periodically runs penetration tests on our entire infrastructure looking for weaknesses, and coordinates with our tech team to ensure everything is patched and kept up to date.</p>
        <p id="e3">3. We use Amazon AWS for hosting. All your data is kept on servers in India, behind the best security that Amazon has to offer.</p>
        <p id="e4">4. Data backup is done every few hours and is accessible only in the case of a catastrophic failure (something which has yet to happen to us thankfully!).</p>
        <p id="e5">5. Nobody in developtrees outside of the Hrms team has access to your data. This is enforced through access control lists and SSO authentication.</p>
        <p id="e6">We have never had a security incident to date, and work hard every day to ensure it stays that way!</p><br>
