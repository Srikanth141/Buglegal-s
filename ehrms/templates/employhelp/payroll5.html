    <p id="e2">HRMS information cannot be modified after the Hrms has been executed. Such changes can lead to differences in the compliance calculations, and it is often not possible to make modifications retrospectively. </p>
    <p id="e1">Hence, if you need to make changes to past Hrms that have already been executed, we suggest that you make the required changes to upcoming Hrmss. For example, if an employee's salary needed to be increased. </p>
    <p id="e3">Then add the additional amount for Hrmss that have already been executed as arrears in an upcoming Hrms.</p>      
    <p id="e4">Calculations will not change, and the employee will get the required modifications in their That way, your past next Hrms.</p><br>
