        <p id="ha1" style="font-size: xx-large;">Why does putting in a deduction lead to a custom salary structure being removed?</p>
        <p id="e">This will usually affect an employee who falls under ESI and PF. Consider an employee with the following custom salary structure -</p>
    <center><table border="2px">
       
       <tr><th>Basic Salary</th><td>  8000</td></tr>
       <tr><th>HRA</th><td>4000</td></tr>
       <tr><th>Special Allowance</th><td>4000</td></tr>
       <tr><th>Employer ESI Contribution</th><td>520</td></tr>
       <tr><th>Employer PF Contribution</th><td>1440</td></tr>
       <tr><th>Gross Monthly Earnings</th><td>17960</td></tr>
    </table></center><br>
    <h3 id="p">Now, let's say we need to put a deduction of Rs 5000 to this month's Hrms. The gross pay, thus, needs to be 17960-5000 = 12960.</h3>
    <p id="p1">How do we accomplish this? A simple way to think about it would be to just remove Rs 5000 from the regular components like special allowance, HRA, and basic salary -</p>
    <center><table border="2px">
        <tr><th>Basic Salary</th><td>5500 (8000-2500)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>HRA</th><td>2750 (4000-1250)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Special Allowance</th><td>2750 (4000-1250)</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Employer ESI Contribution</th><td>520</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Employer PF Contribution</th><td>1440</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Gross Monthly Earnings</th><td>12960</td></tr>
    </table></center><br>
    <p id="q">However, if we do this, then our ESI and PF employer contributions will be incorrect since these are calculated as a percentage of other components (to see how PF and ESI are calculated, please refer to our FAQs here and here).</p> 
    <p id="q1">What needs to be done is that all the components need to be lowered just enough that with the updated PF and ESI values, the gross pay comes out correct. </p>
    <p id="q2">On top of this, there can be added complications of unknown or missing components as well. Overall, this is a problem that cannot be reliably solved using pure math.</p>
    <p id="q3">Hence, in such cases, Hrms removed the custom salary structure and assigned a new structure which that back-calculates from the required gross pay.</p><br>
